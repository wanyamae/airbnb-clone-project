# Database Design
The Airbnb clone project will have tables such as Users, Listings, Bookings and Reviews

## Important Fields (across main tables)
- User ID (in Users table): Uniquely identifies each user.
- Listing ID (in Listings table): Uniquely identifies each property/listing.
- Booking ID (in Bookings table): Uniquely identifies each booking/reservation.
- Review ID (in Reviews table): Uniquely identifies each review.

## Relationships
- Users can create multiple Listings (one-to-many).
- Users can make multiple Bookings (one-to-many).
- Listings can have multiple Bookings (one-to-many).
- Users can leave multiple Reviews for Listings (one-to-many).
- Bookings and Reviews are linked to both Users and Listings via foreign keys.

## Example fields
- Users: `user_id, name, email, password`
- Listings: `listing_id, title, description, price, user_id (owner)`
- Bookings: `booking_id, user_id, listing_id, start_date, end_date`
- Reviews: `review_id, user_id, listing_id, rating, comment`
